        <h2>Leaving for Shanghai</h2>
        <p>I miss my parents, my dog, my home, but it's okay. I miss them because I was happy at home.</p>
        <p>At least every time I saw a train past by, I knew one day I would be on one of them. I see the time at home won't last for long, so instead, I live desperately. I do body exercise, coding projects, walk my dog, learn English accent, read books, for it's the best time I got, I knew it from my heart. As Henry Miller says, I got no money, knew no one, got no job, but I am the happiest man on earth.</p>
        <p>I forgot to shoot a photo of my bookshelves, so I can point out the book I want and ask my mother to send it to me. I forgot my wireless earphone at the last moment. I gave my AirPods to my mom, taught her how to use it, and opened an Apple Music program under my bank account. She asked me, does it costs money? I say 10 RMB every month, and I'm surprised that she didn't act surprised. My mother loves the voice of Teresa Teng, so she must think it's a bargain.</p>
        <p>I told my niece I will go to Shanghai the day after tomorrow. He says, Hum... I will finish my homework within 30 minutes, then we will have a chat, okay? I'm amused, he is just 8 years old.</p>
        <p>It's getting cold since my dog slept in my bed every night. My father found him on the street, and nobody wanted him, so he bought him home. My sister and I decide to give him a bath, so he lives in our home. And he is very naughty, also acted innocent. Once, he sneaked out home and didn't return until next day's night. When he returned, I found a wound on his neck. I took him for a bath, dried him, and he was so tired, he then slept on my bed for hours.</p>
        <p>We played games. "We," I mean, my two nieces and me. Games I mean The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, Yoshi Crafted World, Mario Rabbids Kingdom, Super Smash Bros Ultimate and Splatoon 2.</p>
        <p>My brother drove me to the station, I find a place to stay, It's nicer than the last apartment I lived, so it costs more. I run to the city shop I used to go, the food is cold, taste no good anymore. I bought other daily necessities, but I forgot the slippers. My father asked me to bring along one the other night. I didn't listen.</p>
