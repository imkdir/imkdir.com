        <h2>Story behind Eatles</h2>
        <p>It all started when I stopped eating takeout during lunchtime at work. One night before that, I was shocked by the man in the mirror. I began to remember all those pizza nights, and now I was trapped in a baby version elephant man, no kidding.</p>
        <p>I seemed to lose my appetite, but then I didn't feel hungry. The body scale I bought months ago, lies on the floor, eating dust under the bed, was one of my failed attempts to lose weight, I took it out and wiped it clean.</p>
        <p>After No-Lunch-at-Work becoming a routine, I begin to log my weight, wondering how far it could go. First time in my life, my body is totally under my control, every day I wrote down what I ate, and how much weight I lost so that I can do experiments further. After three months, I lost 20kg(44lbs). Someone might say that's too fast, but it worked, and that was enough for me. What I learned from it can be summed up in three points:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Log your weight, do it to prove that you're in the game. Make it a ritual. This one simple, effortless commitment is the level 1 enemy you will regularly encounter in this game.</li>
            <li>Count your calories. Adjust calories in and out, compare the results, then repeat. Proving something is real by doing experiments on yourself, that's mad science stuff right there.</li>
            <li>Be mindful. People feel disturbed before they need to make a change, no matter it's good or bad. People can slip into their old habits when not watched. A day's binge may set back your progress for weeks, but that's the reality, you have to accept it as fact. Nobody is perfect.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When I started, I had obesity, as I watched my BMI goes from obesity to overweight, then to normal, it feels so good! That's when I begin to think, how to make the experience into an app that can help others achieve their fitness goals.</p>
